# 🚗 SpeedSentry 🚗

## Overview
Welcome to SpeedSentry! This project is developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. The application connects to a Wi-Fi module installed on vehicles to calculate and display the vehicle's speed in real-time. Based on the speed limit data from a maps database, the app rewards or deducts points accordingly.
