# 🚗 SpeedSentry 🚗

## Overview
Introducing SpeedSentry! This project, built with Kotlin in Android Studio, is designed to enhance road safety. The app connects to a Wi-Fi module installed in vehicles, allowing it to calculate and display the vehicle's speed in real time. By utilizing speed limit data from a map database, SpeedSentry either awards points or deducts them based on the driver's adherence to speed limits. Additionally, the app issues three warnings through a bell module if the vehicle surpasses the speed limit, promoting safer driving practices.

## Features
📊 Live Speed Tracking: Continuously monitors and displays the vehicle's speed in real-time.
🔔 Speed Limit Warnings: Alerts drivers through a bell module when the speed limit is exceeded.
🏆 Reward System: Allocates or deducts points depending on compliance with speed limits.
🗺️ Maps Integration: Leverages speed limit information from a maps database to manage rewards and alerts.
